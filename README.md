<p>
A user named "Karen" has reported an issue where employees are unable to access the online banking portal, and those who occasionally can access it are facing login problems. Next go to the Tickets section, we update the SLA (Service Level Agreement) plan to establish a response and resolution time goal for this ticket. In this example, the SLA plan is being changed to "SevA."

<p>
After updating the SLA plan to 'SevA,' assign the ticket to the Online Banking Department.

<p>
In this step, we reassigned Ticket #484412 to an individual agent, Jane Doe, within the Online Banking Department. This action ensures that a specific agent is accountable for addressing the customer’s concern about access to the online banking portal.

Ultimately, you will have the opportunity to respond to the ticket and determine whether it can be resolved or needs to remain open.
